A thousand empty windows
And only half the lights are out
I wonder what these peoples lives
What they might be all about
Do they got a lover
And could they have a family
Or could it be they're just as lonesome
As you and me

I want to shout out
Shout out loud
Why don't you walk
Just come on out
And we can
Tear it all down
Yeah

White lights burning
Down an empty avenue
I wonder if their driver
Found someone he can go on home to

I want to shout out
Shout out loud
Why don't you walk
Just come on out
And we can
Tear it all down
Yeah

'Cause everybody's got a part in the game
And everybody's got a cross they can claim
And everybody's got somebody to blame
But we all must find our own way
Yeah

Want to shout out
Shout out loud
I want to shout out
Shout out loud
I want to shout out
Shout out loud
Shout out loud
Yeah, yeah
Shout out loud
Yeah, yeah
Shout out loud
Shout out loud
Yeah
Shout out loud
Yeah
